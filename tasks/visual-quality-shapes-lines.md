# Visual Quality: Shapes & Lines

## Goals
Enhance geometric elements to achieve hand-drawn, organic comic aesthetic instead of computer-generated appearance.

## Tasks

### 1. Hand-Drawn Line Effects
- [ ] Implement line wobble/roughness for organic feel
- [ ] Add line weight variation along stroke paths
- [ ] Create organic curve generation algorithms
- [ ] Add line ending styles (rounded, tapered, square)

### 2. Enhanced Shape Rendering
- [ ] Add slight imperfections to perfect circles for organic feel
- [ ] Implement variable stroke weights around shapes
- [ ] Create shape outline effects (double lines, sketchy style)
- [ ] Add comic-style fill patterns (crosshatch, dots, lines)

### 3. Stroke Styling Improvements
- [ ] Add dash and dot pattern variations
- [ ] Implement stroke caps and joins customization
- [ ] Create consistent line weight hierarchy
- [ ] Add stroke texture overlays for comic effect

### 4. Geometric Proportions
- [ ] Improve Venn diagram circle overlap calculations
- [ ] Add golden ratio proportions for shape sizing
- [ ] Implement visual balance and weight distribution
- [ ] Create smart spacing algorithms for shape placement

### 5. Comic-Style Shape Effects
- [ ] Add comic panel border styles
- [ ] Implement burst/explosion shape patterns
- [ ] Create speed lines and motion effects
- [ ] Add emphasis shapes for key elements

### 6. Shape Quality Control
- [ ] Add shape rendering quality validation
- [ ] Create shape style consistency testing
- [ ] Implement shape proportion guidelines
- [ ] Test shape rendering across all chart types

## Success Criteria
- Shapes appear hand-drawn rather than computer-generated
- Visual hierarchy through line weights is clear
- Proportions follow comic art best practices
