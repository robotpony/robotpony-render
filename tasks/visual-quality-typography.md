# Visual Quality Improvement: Typography & Text Rendering

## Overview
Improve text rendering to match comic/webcomic aesthetic with proper typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy. Current text rendering lacks the character and visual impact needed for comic-style graphics.

## Goals
- Comic-style typography with proper character and personality
- Improved readability and visual hierarchy
- Better text positioning and spacing
- Enhanced font fallbacks and custom font support
- Proper text effects (outlines, shadows, textures)

- [ ] Add custom web font loading support (Google Fonts, local fonts)
- [ ] Implement font fallback chains for reliable cross-platform rendering
- [ ] Add font weight and style variations (bold, italic, condensed)
- [ ] Create font size scaling system based on canvas size
- [ ] Add font metrics calculation for better positioning

### 2. Text Effects and Styling
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Medium

- [ ] Implement text outlines/strokes for better contrast
- [ ] Add text shadow effects with multiple shadow support
- [ ] Create text background boxes with rounded corners and opacity

- [ ] Add text bounding box calculations for precise layout

### 6. Multi-line Text Support
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: Medium

- [ ] Enhance line breaking algorithms

- [ ] Create consistent spacing between lines

### 7. Accessibility & Readability
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: Low

- [ ] Ensure sufficient contrast ratios for all text
- [ ] Add high contrast mode for improved readability
- [ ] Implement text size accessibility controls
- [ ] Add screen reader friendly text attributes
- [ ] Test text rendering across different browsers

### 8. Performance Optimization
**Priority**: Low  
**Effort**: Low

- [ ] Optimize font loading and caching
- [ ] Minimize text-related SVG bloat
