# Visual Quality: Textures & Effects

## Goals
Add comic book textures and visual effects to create authentic aesthetic with depth and visual richness.

## Tasks

### 1. Paper & Printing Simulation
- [ ] Implement aged paper texture overlays
- [ ] Add vintage printing color separation effects
- [ ] Create ink bleeding and absorption simulation
- [ ] Add paper grain and fiber texture patterns

### 2. Comic Book Halftone Effects
- [ ] Add Ben Day dots/halftone pattern generation
- [ ] Implement screen printing simulation
- [ ] Create color separation halftones
- [ ] Add halftone size and density controls

### 3. Shadow & Lighting System
- [ ] Enhance drop shadow effects with realistic parameters
- [ ] Add cast shadows between overlapping elements
- [ ] Implement highlight and rim lighting effects
- [ ] Create ambient lighting and mood control

### 4. Comic-Specific Visual Effects
- [ ] Add comic book explosion and burst effects
- [ ] Create motion lines and speed streaks
- [ ] Add comic panel borders and gutters
- [ ] Implement emphasis and action effects

### 5. Visual Depth & Dimensionality
- [ ] Add beveling and embossing effects
- [ ] Implement depth layering for foreground/background
- [ ] Create visual weight and hierarchy through effects
- [ ] Add isometric and perspective effects

### 6. Performance & Optimization
- [ ] Optimize texture rendering performance
- [ ] Add effect quality settings (low, medium, high)
- [ ] Create effect caching and reuse systems
- [ ] Optimize SVG output size with effects

## Success Criteria
- Visual output matches comic book reference quality
- Effects enhance rather than distract from content
- Performance remains acceptable with effects enabled
